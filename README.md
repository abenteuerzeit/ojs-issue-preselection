## Technical Details

### Architecture

The plugin uses OJS's hook system exclusively for integration:

- **Schema Hooks**: Extend issue and submission schemas with custom fields
- **Form Hooks**: Add UI elements to issue and submission forms
- **Template Hooks**: Display selected issue in review section
- **Validation Hooks**: Process issue assignment and editor assignment on
  submission

### Data Storage

Uses OJS's existing settings tables (no database migrations required):

- `issue_settings`: Stores `isOpen` (boolean) and `editedBy` (array of user IDs)
- `submission_settings`: Stores `preselectedIssueId` (integer)
- `publications`: Uses existing `issueId` field for scheduling
